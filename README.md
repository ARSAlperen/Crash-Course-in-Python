# Crash-Course-in-Python

Let's face it, us humans are flawed and sometimes we make mistakes, a human performing the same tasks hundreds of times will never be as consistent as a machine doing the same thing.

Automating tasks allows you to focus on projects that are a better use of your time, letting computers do the boring stuff for you.


->What’s the difference between a program and a script? 
  ->There’s not much difference, but scripts are usually simpler and shorter.
  
  Like human language, the intended meaning or effect of words, or in this case instructions, are referred to as semantics.
  
  ->So why pick Python? 
    ->programming in Python usually feels similar to using a human language.
    
If your syntax is correct, but the script has unexpected behavior or output, this may be due to a semantic problem. Remember that syntax is the rules of how code is constructed, while semantics are the overall effect the code has. It is possible to have syntactically correct code that runs successfully, but doesn't do what we want it to do.
